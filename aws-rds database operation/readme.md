##### &nbsp;                   **AWS RDS – PostgreSQL Database Creation and Connection using DBeaver**





This repository documents my hands-on learning with AWS RDS (PostgreSQL).  

I created an RDS PostgreSQL instance, set up a database, and successfully connected it using **DBeaver**



**🧰 Tools \& Technologies Used**

\- AWS RDS

\- PostgreSQL

\- DBeaver

\- AWS Management Console





**🛠️ What I Did**



1\. Created an AWS instance using the default security group.

2\. Later modified the security group inbound rules to allow database access from my IP.

3\. Created a database inside the RDS service.

4\. Connected the database to DBeaver using the RDS endpoint.





**🔐 Security Note**

\- No usernames, passwords, or sensitive details are shared.

\- The RDS instance was created under **AWS Free Tier** and deleted after testing.



**📸 Screenshots Included**
